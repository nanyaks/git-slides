# GDG LAGOS GIT EVENT

This is the AWS slide for the GDG Cloud event held on the 14th December at the CCHUB in Lagos, Nigeria.

## Trainer
`[Nanyak](https://github.com/nanyaks)`

## Setup
To set this up on your system, just run:

```git clone http://github.com/nanyaks/git-slides.git```

The above command will give you a local copy of the project checked out to a directory in your system.

#### Note:
you should have git installed and working for this to work; you could just alternatively download the zip archive of the project.

## Installation
Just open the index.html with a browser and it should work fine.

## Dependencies
- [reveal.js](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slideshow library.

If you want to have the repo installed with Grunt will also need to have grunt.js [installed](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#installation) to build and run it from ( http://localhost:8000/ ) in your browser of choice ( any recent browser will do ) as the library uses some CSS 3 mojo and should render properly on recent browsers.
